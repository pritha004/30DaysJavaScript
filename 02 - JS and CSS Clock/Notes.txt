Things I learnt:
-----------------

1. background-size css property sets the background image to the size of the div.

2. transform-origin css property changes the point of rotation/transform (by default at center).
Here we made-- transform-origin: bottom;

3. absolute & relative css property
To make the child components be in sync with the parent component during resizing, make parent compenent relative and child absolute.
position: relative;
To move the child component to desired position we can use these properties:
top: 26%;
left: 49.3%;

4. new Date()--- gets the current date and time, has functions like getHours(),getSeconds().

5. Rotation of the hour, min and second hands is calculated as:
12hour=360deg
1hour=360/12 deg
h hour=30h deg
But hour hand moves with minute increment, so we add the degree change too:
1hour=30deg
60min=30deg
1min=1/2deg
m min=m/2deg

So, total hour deg change= 30h+ (m/2)deg

Same for seconds and minutes:
60 minute=360deg
m minute=6m deg
Here minute hand too moves with second increment but its negligible so we ignore it.

60 second=360deg
s second=6s deg

6. setInterval method
